# js-libp2p-kad-dht

js-libp2p-kad-dht is a JavaScript implementation of the Kademlia DHT with some features of S/Kademlia. A "provider" node uses the DHT to advertise that it has a particular piece of content, and "querying" nodes will search the DHT for peers that have a particular piece of content. Content is modeled as a value that is identified by a key, where the key and value are Buffers.

#### DHT Identifiers

The DHT uses a sha2-256 hash for identifiers:
- For peers the DHT identifier is the hash of the [PeerId][PeerId]
- For content the DHT identifier is the hash of the key (eg a Block CID)

#### FIND_NODE

`findPeer (PeerId):` [PeerInfo][PeerInfo]

The address space is so large (256 bits) that there are big gaps between DHT ids, and nodes frequently join and leave the DHT.

To find a particular node
- the `querying node` converts the [PeerId][PeerId] to a DHT id
- the `querying node` sends a request to the nearest peers to that DHT id that it knows about
- those peers respond with the nearest peers to the DHT id that they know about
- the `querying node` sorts the responses and recursively queries the closest peers to the DHT id, continuing until it finds the node or it has queried all the closest peers.

#### PUT value

`put (Key, Value)`

To store a value in the DHT, the `provider node`
- converts the key to a DHT id
- follows the "closest peers" algorithm as above to find the nearest peers to the DHT id
- sends the value to those nearest peers

Note that DHT nodes will only store values that are accepted by its "validators", configurable functions that validate the key/value to ensure the node can control what kind of content it stores (eg IPNS records).

#### GET value

`get (Key): [Value]`

To retrieve a value from the DHT
- the `querying node` converts the key to a DHT id
- the `querying node` follows the "closest peers" algorithm to find the nearest peers to the DHT id
- at each iteration of the algorithm, if the peer has the value it responds with the value itself in addition to closer peers.

Note that because the DHT is asynchronous, the value for a particular key may be different at each node (not synchronized), so `GET value` may return distinct values. The DHT has "selectors", configurable functions that choose the "best" value (eg the most recently modified).

#### PROVIDE value

`provide (Key)`

To advertise that it has the content for a particular key
- the `provider node` converts the key to a DHT id
- the `provider node` follows the "closest peers" algorithm to find the nearest peers to the DHT id
- the `provider node` sends a "provide" message to each of the nearest peers
- each of the nearest peers saves the association between the "provider" peer and the key

#### FIND_PROVIDERS for value

`findProviders (Key):` [[PeerInfo][PeerInfo]]

To find providers for a particular key
- the `querying node` converts the key to a DHT id
- the `querying node` follows the "closest peers" algorithm to find the nearest peers to the DHT id
- at each iteration of the algorithm, if the peer knows which nodes are providing the value it responds with the provider nodes in addition to closer peers.
